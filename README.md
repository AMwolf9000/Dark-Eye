How to load into browser for Chromium / Firefox

Chrome: Download to zip file (make sure to unzip and extract the files before trying to load it)
        then go to chrome -> manage extensions -> turn on dev mode (top right) -> load unpacked 
        and select the root folder which has the files in it.

Firefox: DOES NOT WORK ON CURRENT VERSION
         use version 1.2.0 instead in branch: Firefox-stable
         (will be fixed at a later date)
